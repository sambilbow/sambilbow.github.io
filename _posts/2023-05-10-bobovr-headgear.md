## BoboVR M2 Plus 

Adaptor designed and shared by Noah Zerkin
> Had to cut and grind down the slide receivers on that headgear. Want to make one more tweak tomorrow and will post. Ergonomics arenâ€™t bad, even without the foam forehead pad thatâ€™s missing from this one. Adjustability isnâ€™t as smooth or clever as FLZeroâ€™s, but thereâ€™s actually a little more of it in terms of vertical repositioning, and slides out at least far enough to accommodate my glasses.
