The past few weeks have been spent getting familiar with a North Star (NS) headset workflow on Linux. As part of CoMuse I hope to move towards a fully open-source stack for multi-user musical AR experience. Instructions are for Arch-based systems, e.g. EndeavourOS, and assumes a Wayland compositor (rather than X11).

**Proposed Linux Workflow**

## OpenXR (Open Standard XR API)
- openxr-git

## Monado (OpenXR Runtime for GNU/Linux)
- monado-git

## Ultraleap (Hand Tracking)

Ultraleap have released their Gemini V5 tracking software as a beta for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. However, the binaries are still accessible via their repository for non-Debian Linux systems. The repository links are provided below for those not on Debian-based systems:
- [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://repo.ultraleap.com/apt/pool/main/u/ultraleap-hand-tracking-service/ultraleap-hand-tracking-service_5.6.3.0-18a4db52-1.0_amd64.deb) `ultraleap-hand-tracking-service`  - a background service that attaches to Ultraleap devices.
- [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://repo.ultraleap.com/apt/pool/main/u/ultraleap-hand-tracking-control-panel/ultraleap-hand-tracking-control-panel_684937.deb) `ultraleap-hand-tracking-control-panel`  - a GUI application that shows cameras & info.
- [‚¨áÔ∏è](https://repo.ultraleap.com/apt/pool/main/o/openxr-layer-ultraleap/openxr-layer-ultraleap_1.3.1_amd64.deb) `openxr-layer-ultraleap`  - an OpenXR layer that allows Ultraleap devices connect at the API layer.

Unarchive the `.deb` from each repository, then do the same with the `data.tar.xz` inside (you can ignore `control.tar.xz`, this only contains meta-information about the package), and place all sub-directory files in their respective folders on your operating system using `sudo mv [file path] [destination path]`.

A quirk of running North Star on Linux is that the UVC
