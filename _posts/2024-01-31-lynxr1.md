        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/lynx-me-2.png" title="" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

## Included
- Lynx-R1 Mixed Reality Headset
- 3-4 foot USB-C - USB-C cable
- VR interface
- Head strap
- Spare lens

## Quality
The build quality is in general, pretty good, although the VR interface magnets aren't glued in particularly well and I've had to redo it myself.

## Software
The Lynx comes with an integrated hub / launcher that comes with an onboarding experience, and the Wolvic browser. It can be run in AR/VR.

I assume it can be compiled to as an Android target with the right OpenXR loader. As Godot supports Lynx out of the box, I will probably choose that for development, following the below tutorial.
