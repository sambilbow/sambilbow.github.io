    <p>Continuing with the themes of Performance, Embodiment and Vocality, in this new practice-based project we are looking more closely at Human / Robot interaction. Working with musicians, programmers and a Pepper Robot we will explore musical and theatrical relationships across the human / robot divide.  We will share our findings through performance, demonstrations and discussion on Friday 28th June at 3:30pm in the Sussex Humanities Lab (Silverstone 211, University of Sussex).</p>
