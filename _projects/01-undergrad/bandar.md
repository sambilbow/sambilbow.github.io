    <h3>summary</h3>
    <p>
        This essay aims to investigate BandAR, the app I have created for this creative music project. My motivation for this project is partly trying to get the most out of my smartphone and new technology such as augmented reality and image recognition, but also the apparent lack of engaging and intuitive augmented reality apps on the App Store. BandAR at its core is an exploration into the collaboration between music and augmented reality. The user is presented with a camera view, that they can point at up to 6 printed QR codes. The image recognition service paired with my Unity project replaces these QR codes with 3D models of 6 different instruments on separate stages. The user can move their device closer to the instruments resulting in a louder volume, and click on the instrument to change some effects parameters for a reverb, echo, chorus, and a high-pass filter.
