## Summary
As a direct consequence of witnessing participants enjoyment and play with [polaris~](../polaris/), I recognised for the first time looking from the outside in, that the system had a larger propensity for fostering learning, virtuosity, and depth of expression than I had originally thought; if only the experience was slightly more complex, the interactions more nuanced. The gestures, play, and expression by participants led to a kind of quasi-transhumanist dance, one that struck me as a technologically mediated dialogue between hybrid self and hybrid environment -- a delicate balance of agency.

polygons~ is a fifteen-minute experimental audiovisual AR improvisation using an AR performance ecosystem including three instruments: `ambi`, `click-+`, and `hands`.
